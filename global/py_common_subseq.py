"""Implementation and variations on calACS-DP.

Implementation of the calACS-DP (all common subsequences - dynamic programming)
algorithm as presented in Hui Wang's "All common subsequences."
IJCAI 2007:635-640 (ACM). This module also introduces a variation which can
produce a list all of those common subsequences. Additionally, both the classic
implementation as well as the variation offer some space optimizations
similar to those found in longest common subsequence imeplementations.
